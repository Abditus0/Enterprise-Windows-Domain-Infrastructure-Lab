## Knowledge Prerequisites  
- Basic Windows administration  
- Fundamental networking concepts (IP addressing, DNS)  
- Virtual machine management
## Implementation Guide  
### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup  
### Step 1: Domain Controller Virtual Machine Creation  
The first step involves creating our primary domain controller which will serve as the foundation for all domain services.  
### VM Configuration:  
- Name: TechStart-DC01  
- OS: Windows Server 2022 Standard  
- RAM: 4GB minimum  
- Storage: 60GB  
- Network: Internal Network (VirtualBox)
### Step 2: Windows Server 2022 Installation  
Install Windows Server 2022 Standard with Desktop Experience to provide GUI management capabilities essential for administration and demonstration purposes.  
### Critical Installation Choice:  
- Select "Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience)"  <img width="602" height="27" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-27 125825" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89e1762e-e08f-49cb-9fc8-539a227b5568" />  
- NOT Server Core (command-line only)
### Step 3: Initial Server Configuration  
After installation, Server Manager provides the central hub for all server role and feature management.

### Key Configuration Steps:  
- Computer Name: Change from default to TechStart-DC01  
- Windows Updates: Configure automatic updates (enterprise consideration)  
### Step 4: Network Configuration  
Static IP configuration is essential for domain controllers to ensure consistent service availability.  
### Network Settings:  
- IP Address: 192.168.10.10  
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
- Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1  
- Primary DNS: 192.168.10.10 (self-referencing)  
- Secondary DNS: 8.8.8.8 (external fallback)

### Phase 2: Active Directory Domain Services  
### Step 5: Installing Active Directory Domain Services Role  
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) provides the foundation for domain authentication, authorization, and directory services.  
### Installation Process:  
- Server Manager â†’ Add Roles and Features  
- Select "Active Directory Domain Services"  
- Include management tools when prompted  
- Complete installation (requires restart)

### What AD DS Provides:  
- Centralized authentication  
- User and computer account management  
- Group Policy infrastructure  
- DNS integration  
- Certificate Services foundation

### Step 6: Domain Controller Promotion  
Promoting the server to domain controller creates the forest root domain and initializes the Active Directory database.  
### Domain Configuration:  
- Deployment Type: Add a new forest  
- Root Domain Name: techstart.local  
- Forest/Domain Functional Level: Windows Server 2016 or higher  
- Domain Controller Options: DNS Server (checked)  
- DSRM Password: Strong password for Directory Services Restore Mode

### Why .local TLD (Top-Level Domain):   
While not internet-routable, .local provides clear separation between internal and external namespaces in lab environments.  

### Step 7: Post-Promotion Verification  
After restart, verify successful domain controller promotion and service functionality.

### Verification Checklist:  
- Login shows TECHSTART\Administrator  
- DNS service running  
- Active Directory Domain Services started  
- Event logs show successful promotion

### Phase 3: Active Directory Organizational Structure  
### Step 8: Organizational Unit Design  
Proper OU design reflects business structure and enables efficient Group Policy application and administrative delegation.  
### OU Structure Design:
